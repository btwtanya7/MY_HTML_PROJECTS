        <h2>Introduction To C++:</h2>
      <p>C++ is a versatile, high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language, adding object-oriented features. It's known for its performance, memory control, and flexibility, making it suitable for various applications like operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance software. C++ supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms....</p>
      <h3>Features of C++:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
          C++ implements OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enabling code reuse, modularity, and easier maintenance. </li>
        <li>Structured Programming:
          C++ follows a structured approach, promoting code readability, maintainability, and organization through functions and modules. </li>
        <li>Platform Dependence:
          C++ programs are compiled for specific platforms, providing performance optimization but also requiring modifications for cross-platform compatibility. </li>
        <li>Pointers:
          C++ uses pointers to directly access memory addresses, enabling low-level programming and performance optimization. </li>
        <li>Powerful and Fast:
          C++ is known for its speed and power, enabling the creation of high-performance applications and systems programming. </li>
          
      </ul>
      <h2>Basic Syntax:</h2>
      <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-jsEbeVUAAU5sJ.png" alt="Basic Syntax" height="250"> 
      <ul>
        <li>The #include directive is crucial for incorporating header files, which provide declarations of necessary functions and classes. </li>
        <li>The main() function is where the program's execution begins. </li>
        <li>Function calls and the return statement are fundamental for controlling program flow. </li>
        <li>Namespaces help organize code and prevent naming conflicts. </li>
        <li>Classes and objects are the core of C++'s object-oriented programming paradigm. </li>
        <li>Structures are user-defined data types that can hold related data. </li>
      </ul></p>
      <h3>Application of C++:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Operating Systems:
          C++ is a fundamental language for building operating systems due to its low-level control and performance capabilities. </li>
        <li>Embedded Systems:
          C++ is used in embedded systems for its ability to interact directly with hardware and manage resources efficiently. </li>
        <li>Game Development:
          C++ is a popular choice for game engines and game development due to its speed and ability to handle complex graphics and simulations. </li>
        <li>Web Development:
          C++ powers many web browsers and server-side applications, particularly those requiring high performance. </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Introduction To Arrays:</h2>
    <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
    <p>Arrays in C++ are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. All elements in an array are of the same data type and are accessed using an index. The first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.</p>
    <img src="WhatsApp Image 2025-04-16 at 16.59.39_3c57ab66.jpg" alt="Array picture" height="200">
    <h3>Characterstics Of Arrays:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
      <li>Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array are of the same data type.</li>
      <li>Indexed Access: Elements are accessed using their index, starting from 0.</li>
      <li>Contiguous Memory: Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.</li>
      <li>Efficient Access: Provides fast access to elements using indices (O(1) time).</li>
      <li>Iteration: Arrays can be easily traversed using loops.</li>
      <li>Static or Dynamic (depending on language): In some languages (like C), arrays are static; in others (like Python or JavaScript), dynamic arrays exist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types Of Arrays:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>One-Dimensional Array: A linear list of elements, accessed with a single index.</li>
      <li>Two-Dimensional Array: An array of arrays, often used to represent matrices or tables.</li>
      <li>Multi-Dimensional Array: Arrays with more than two dimensions, useful for complex data structures.</li>
      <li>Dynamic Array: An array that can grow or shrink in size during runtime (e.g., ArrayList in Java, list in Python).</li>
      <li>Jagged Array: An array of arrays where inner arrays can have different lengths (e.g., in C# or Java).</li>
      <li>Associative Array: Also known as maps or dictionaries; uses key-value pairs (e.g., objects in JavaScript, dictionaries in Python).</li>

      <h2>Introduction To Trees:</h2>
      <p>In C++, a tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, representing a non-linear relationship. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, forming a root-to-leaf hierarchy. Trees are implemented using pointers, allowing for flexible node connections and traversal. </p>

       <li>Subtree: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.</li>
       <li>Depth: The level of a node in the tree, starting from the root (depth 0).</li>
       <li>Height: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.</li>
       <li>No Cycles: Trees do not contain any cycles or loops.</li>
       <li>Connected: All nodes are connected, and there is exactly one path between any two nodes.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Types Of Trees:</h3>
     <ol>
       <li>Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).</li>
       <li>Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.</li>
       <li>AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in height between left and right subtrees is at most 1.</li>
       <li>Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree with specific coloring rules to maintain balance during insertions and deletions.</li>
       <li>B-Tree: A self-balancing search tree used in databases and file systems, where nodes can have more than two children.</li>
       <li>Heap Tree: A complete binary tree used to implement priority queues (e.g., max-heap, min-heap).</li>
       <li>Trie (Prefix Tree): A tree used to store strings, where each node represents a character.</li>
       <li>Segment Tree: A tree used for storing intervals or segments and efficiently answering range queries.</li>
